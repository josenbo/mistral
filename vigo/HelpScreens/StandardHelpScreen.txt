USAGE:
  vigo <repository-dir> [-b <file>] [-t <list>] [-r <file>] [-p]
  vigo -h|--help
  vigo -v|--version

ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS:
  <repository-dir>        Define the top-level directory for walking the 
                          repositories directory tree and processing files.
                          Required value. Directory must exist.
                          Environment variable: VIGO_REPOSITORY
                           
  -b, --bundle <file>     The name (and optional path) of the deployment
                          bundle. The name is resolved relative to the 
                          current working directory. The file name must 
                          have a .tar.gz suffix and the directory must
                          exist.
                          Environment variable: VIGO_BUNDLE
                            
  -t, --targets <list>    Optional parameter to filter the build targets
                          which are written to the deployment bundle.
                          If missing, all build targets are present in
                          the deployment bundle. The targets can be 
                          separated by space, comma or semicolon.
                          Example: -t "test,production" 
                          Environment variable: VIGO_TARGETS
                          
  -r, --report <file>     Optional spreadsheet file name (with optional
                          path) which will describe hao files were mapped
                          to the deployment bundle. The name is resolved 
                          relative to the current working directory. The 
                          file name must have a .xlsx suffix and the 
                          directory must exist.
                          Environment variable: VIGO_REPORT
                            
  -p, --preview           Optional flag. If present, file PREVIEW rules 
                          will be included in the deployment bundle.
                          This is used primarily in commit checks.
                          Environment variable: VIGO_PREVIEW (any value)
                            
  -h, --help              Display this help screen
  
  -v, --version           Display version information
